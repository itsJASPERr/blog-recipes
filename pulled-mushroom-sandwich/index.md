### Ingredients

- 250g Oyster Mushrooms (Austernpilze)
- 250g King Oyster Mushrooms (Kr√§uterseitlinge)
- 100g pineapple
- 2 red onions
- 3 cloves garlic
- 5 tbs agave sirup
- 5 tbs maple sirup
- 4 tbs olive oil
- 1 tbs cumin
- 1 tbs parika (spicy)
- 2 tbs soy sauce
- 1 tsp cayenne
- 2 tsp tumeric
- salt
- pepper
- 1 lime
- 1 tsp liquid smoke (optional)
- 1 hand full fresh cilantro (optional)

### Instructions

1. Use a fork to "pull" the mushrooms into stripes as much as possible. Cut the rest and the heads in stripes. And add to a large bowl.
2. Halve the onions and cut them sideways into thin slices. Add them to the mushrooms.
3. Add the spices, soy sauce, 1-2 tbs olive oil, 1 tbs agave, 1 tbs maple sirup, and liqiud smoke. Mix well and let that marinate for a bit.
4. Meanwhile, blend the pinapple into a purree (you could add roasted red bell pepper if you fancy)
5. Heat up a non-sticky pan with 2 tbs oil.
6. Add the mushrroms mix and roast on medium heat. Make sure to not stir too much, rather let them sit on one side for a couple of minutes, then stir. This will create some crunchy parts. Over the time, keep adding the rest of agave and maple sirup.
7. After about 6 minutes Add the pineapple purree and chopped garlic
8. Cook to your preferred consistency (probable something between 12 and 25 minutes)
9. Move the mixture to a serving bowl, add juice of half a lime, salt and pepper to taste
10. Optional: mix in chopped cilantro
